########### FTP Server Configuration ##############

hostnamectl
hostnamectl set-hostname ftp.server  ============= set static hostname first

(then log out and log in to see changes)

dnf repolist all                     ========= check if repositories are configured or not

(now you need two packages to use FTP one is FTP and next is VSFTPD 
FTP is for command and vsftpd is for service)

dnf install -y ftp vsftpd           ================ install packages

(check FTP config file in ll /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf and backup this file vsftpd.conf.bkp)

cp -rv /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf.bkp  ==============

(now you can enable anonymous user inside the conf file and make it yes)

systemctl start vsftpd.service    ========== start the service 
systemctl enable vsftpd.service   ========== enable the service
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ftp --zone=public  =========== alow ftp traffic from firewall
firewall-cmd --reload  ======== reload to implement changes
firewall-cmd --list-all ========= check

ftp 192.168.x.x    ============== access the FTP from client machine

(for downloading files use  "get filename" for upload "put filename" an for multiple file downloads use "mget f1 f2 f3")
(if you are using local user then you will be directed to "/home" directory and if you are using anonymous user then the default path "/var/ftp/pub")
(for anonymous user password should be "abc@gmail.com" )
(use bye for exit)

NOTE: for more you can play with vsftpd.conf file and can allow or deny users and can change the ports for communication as well.
