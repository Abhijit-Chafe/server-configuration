********** for Host Machine ************

(set hostname first)
hostnamectl
hostnamectl set-hostname nfsserver.nehraclasses.local  ====== setting hostname

(Rlogin to apply changes)

dnf repolist all  ======== check all repository are configured and enabled
dnf install nfs-utils -y  ========= install packages of nfs-utils
systemctl start nfs-server.service
systemctl enable nfs-server.service
systemctl status nfs-server.service

rpcinfo -p | grep nfs  =============== check if service is working on port 2049
mkdir -p /mnt/nfs_shares/docs ====== make directory to share with client to access files
(now this will use the / partition share and ownership should be of user "nobody" which is service account inside /etc/shadow we can find it )
(we need ti=o give full acces to the share partition)
chmod -R 777 /mnt/nfs_shares/docs  ======= giving all permision so that all user can use it
systemctl restart nfs-utils.service  ======== restart the service

(now we need to mention the share in the configuratuon file)

***** now vim the file vim /etc/exports file and type following *****
/mnt/nfs_shares/docs clientip(rw,sync,no_all_squash,root_squash)
cat /etc/exports   ===== conform file contents once

exportfs -arv  ==== export

firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nfs  ========= define firewall so that it should not block nfs request
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=rpc-bind ========== service which redirect client on proper port no 
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=mountd =========== allow remote host to mount file system
firewall-cmd --reload 
firewall-cmd --list-all  ===check


********** for Client Machine ************

hostnamectl set-hostname nfsclient.nehraclasses.local  ====== setting hostname
Re-login and check hostname
dnf repolist all 
dnf install nff-utils
dnf install nfs4-acl-tools 
showmount -e serverip 
mkdir -p /mnt/client_share ======= create dir 
mount -t nfs serverip:/mnt/nfs_shares/docs/ /mnt/client_share
df -h  ========verify 
nfsstats  ==== nfs version
mount | grep -i nfs

********* now we will create file in server side and make a file in /mnt/nfs_shares/docs/ ***********
echo nehra classes are awesome > server_nfs_file.txt
ll -lrth

NOTE: what file you created will same be reflected in client path and file created in client side can be access from server (vice versa)
make fstab entry in client side
